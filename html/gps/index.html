		<p>Semantic HTML tags are meant to clearly convey both the meaning of the tag to the browser and the developer. Rather than governing how content should be displayed (that's up to the stylesheet), these tags are used to show the meaning of individual sections within the greater context of the page. These tags can also be used by assistive software for differently abled users to identify the different elements in a page to help them access the content.</p>
		<p>I'm a little confused by this next question, so I'll answer it as I understand it. The browser will display HTML in the order the code appears in the HTML file. For that reason, when a dev forgets to close an anchor tag, a link could continue for the rest of the page.</p>
		<p>The snippet section of this module really showed me how powerful and versatile Sublime is--I am going to take your advice to heart and get better acquainted with the other shortcuts in Sublime. I'm seeing now just how much time I can save with the shortcuts that are already built in, not to mention those that I will be able to create myself.</p>
		<p>The most difficult part of the challenge to me was trying to understand the snippet. In retrospect, it is a very easy concept--I think there was a breakdown in communication between me and my pair (I was relying on him to give me all the instructions and info while we worked), so that kept me from catching on as fast as I could have otherwise. As for new concepts, semantic tags are new for me. The last time I worked with HTML was before they were a thing. I understand their purpose, but I think I just need to work with them more to become better acquainted. I'm really excited to learn more about their applications with assistive technologies--making content accessible to more users is something I am very passionate about!</p>

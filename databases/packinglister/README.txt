Welcome to PackingLister!
This app is designed to build and manipulate packing/to-do lists to prepare for trips.

Please be sure to install the gems 'io/console' and 'sqlite3' before running.
In order to run the fake data populator, you must also install 'faker'.

Please run the fake data populator in order to create a new database populated with 50 fake users and 200 fake lists containing 2100 fake hipstery things to pack.

Or you can just run packinglister itself to get started with some real data. 

Enjoy and bon voyage, mes chers amis!

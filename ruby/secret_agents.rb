# Encrypt Method Pseudocode
# 
# Define a method that takes a string of text and advances each character of the string index by index one letter forward.
# Create a parameter that is a string of text with parameter name 'x'
# Define variable 'output' as a new string and a new variable 'index' equal to 0.
# Build a loop until index equals length of the string.
# Add to the variable output the next value of the index of 'x.'
# Add 1 to index.
# End the loop.
# Print variable output.

# Decrypt Method Pseudocode
#
# Define a method that takes a string of text and reverses each character by one letter in the alphabet.
# Define 'alphabet' variable that is a string of all letters in the alphabet.
# Define variable 'output' as a new string and a new variable 'index' equal to 0.
# Build a loop until index equals length of the string.
# Add to the variable output the following:
# The value of the following index of the variable alphabet
# 1 less than the index of alphabet at the following character within the string 'alphabet.'
# The index of 'y' at the variable index.
# Add 1 to index.
# End the loop.
# Print variable output.
